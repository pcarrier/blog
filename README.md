# A blog about nothing

## Getting started

Integrate [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) with your shell, then run `direnv allow`.

Run the blog locally with `blog start`, build it into `dist` with `blog build`.

## Deployment

Join the blog team through an [xmit](https://xmit.co/) invite. Having set up `direnv` as instructed above, run `blog set-key`. You can now deploy with `blog deploy`.

Alternatively, push to the `deploy` branch.
