Even as I've grown into a full-fledged adult, I find modern handhelds rather big.

Switch Lite, in light gray, barely fits case in my pocket. Steam Deck, in dark gray, requires a fair bit of bag space.

As much as I appreciate the option of accessing many of my Steam games on the go, I carry the Switch Lite more than the Steam Deck.

I hope the trend reverts back. New 3DS XL, in red, already feels rather big in a pocket.

Retro gamers have plenty of options, some clearly too small for my hands. The Analogue Pocket, on the right below, feels a bit cramped after a long session of [Tetris](/posts/tetromino/).
