Not much to talk about publicly today.

Clocks jumped back 1 hour last night. Insert rant about societal inertia.

On the subject of time zones, if you're the kind of person who likes to read encyclopediae for fun, [`tzdata`](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) can be a fascinating read.

I hope not to offend with those quotes. Time keeping does evolve through colonialism, conflicts, and politics.

> of Bayan-Ölgii, Khovd and Uvs in UTC+7, and the rest of the country in
> UTC+8. The second configuration, mentioned in a comment to the database in
> 2001, lists Bayan-Ölgii, Khovd, Uvs, Govi-Altai and Zavkhan in UTC+7, Dornod
> and Sükhbaatar in UTC+9, and the rest of the country in UTC+8.
