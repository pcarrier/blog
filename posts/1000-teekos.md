title: Made 1000 Teekos… Now what?

_After my favourite video games, [Tetris](/posts/tetromino) and [N++](/posts/n++), time to post about my favourite board game._

My first encounter with Teeko was in 2016, running into [its Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teeko) and devouring Blake Eskin's [2001 WaPo article](https://pcarrier.com/teeko/archives/text/Eskin-Blake-article.txt).

After [a journey of many seasons](https://pcarrier.com/teeko), I'm running an online version, and own over 900 physical copies of my own take (as a few were gifted or traded).

It feels like merely the beginning though.

## [Online version](https://teeko.cc): needs work!

The online version was built around my personal desire for remote play, and to turn my phone into a board at an instant's notice. It's functional for both. But…

- It lacks bots. A shame given the game was solved by [Guy L. Steele Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_L._Steele_Jr.) through a brute force search in 1998 and I have a copy of the solution, which produces an O(1) lookup database of position to outcome given optimal play.
- It isn't inviting. I'm sure a lot could be done, and given the elegance of the game itself, it wouldn't be lipstick on a pig.

## Physical version: needs distribution?

The original trademark, registration #519087, expired in 2021. I have no problem distributing the game under its original name, and my design is distinct enough.

The stocks for boards, pieces, and bags are living in my bedroom closet. I have yet to print rules, and some assembly is required, but it's otherwise ready.

You can write to [preorders@teeko.cc](mailto:preorders@teeko.cc), but I have no concrete plans to distribute it beyond hand-delivering it around me at the moment.
