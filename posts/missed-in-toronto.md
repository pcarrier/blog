Of the many places I've visited in Toronto, a few instantly come to mind as dearly missed.

Granted, they're all from or near my old neighbourhood. But that only makes visiting them all easier.

## [Egg Club](https://eggclub.ca)

Yes, it's a promotional photo. But that's the real deal.

If you're into the premise, every sandwich on [their menu](https://eggclub.ca/the-best-egg-sandwich-in-toronto/) is fantastic.

Don't miss their hash browns. They come in the menu offer, unfortunately with brewed coffee that's only so-so.

## [Page One Cafe](https://pageonecafe.com/)

A cafe + bar. Despite living in San Francisco before, this is where I finally got into speciality coffee. Nice collection of typewriters.

## [Tsujiri](https://tsujiri.ca)

I love matcha in all its forms. From o matcha to parfaits and shaved ice through lattes and cakes, I've had immense joy going through Tsujiri's menu.

## [Icha Tea](https://ichateashop.com/)

A bit further west from the rest, very much worth the walk. Great selection of premium teas served gongfu, delicious-looking desserts (never tried), a calm atmosphere, laptop-friendly.
