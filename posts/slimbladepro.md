I used a [SlimBlade trackball](https://www.kensington.com/p/products/ergonomic-desk-accessories/ergonomic-input-devices/slimblade-trackball/) a few years ago. I had given up on it mostly because of its low DPI.

Ordered its successor, the [SlimBlade Pro](https://www.kensington.com/p/products/electronic-control-solutions/trackball-products/slimblade-pro-trackball/), at the beginning of the week.

It's wireless. DPI is configurable past what I want for my 8K display. Only thing I'm missing is software configurability. In short, I wish it let me:

- Click on the bottom buttons together to trigger a middle click;
- Click on the top buttons to go backward and forward in browsers;
- Hold the top-right button and move the ball around to scroll in all directions (horizontal + vertical).

Only the last point is missing from their solution, KensingtonWorks. Unfortunately, it's entirely broken in Sequoia, so I'm stuck with the default behaviour. Might try to build my own Mac software at some point.

That being said, those are only wants, not needs, and the SlimBlade Pro has already replaced the [Logitech MX Ergo](https://www.logitech.com/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.html) as my input device of choice.

I go to Twin Labs' Paris office about 2 days every 2 weeks; there it was with me:

Great opportunity to add to the list of hardware from [my desk post](/posts/desk/) with items I take out to compose music:

- [Focal Elex headphones](https://www.focal.com/products/elex);
- [Arturia MiniLab 3](https://www.arturia.com/products/hybrid-synths/minilab-3/overview).
