I'm mildly excited to be using a _remote_ soon.

Nintendo doesn't produce Wiimotes anymore. They're unnecessarily bulky for my needs anyway.

[Logitech Spotlight](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/presenters/spotlight-presentation-remote.910-004654.html) is over 110€ here. For a BLE clicker with an accelerometer and gyroscope!?

Ordered Apple's 69€ answer to the problem of controlling my computer from my couch.

Apple's ecosystem appears to provide software for all my needs, and hopefully that won't break with macOS releases (looking at an Elgato capture device and a Brother scanner now stuck in my closet).

[BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) seems a bit messy. [Remote Buddy 2](https://www.iospirit.com/products/remotebuddy/) looks great. I'll report back here after a bit.
