After [yesterday's post](/posts/form2mail/) turned from design doc to a complete implementation including features initially planned for further iterations, I'm going to keep it short today.

Proud owner of a [Sony XDR-S61D](https://www.sony.fr/electronics/radios-dab/xdr-s61d), I've been enjoying DAB+ radio for a few months now.

It's a lovely experience:

- A wider range of stations than FM ever offered here. I listen almost exclusively to [FIP](https://www.radiofrance.fr/fip) which isn't available on FM in Grenoble.
- The benefits of reliable digital audio. No tuning, zero static, no audible defects through a small cheap speaker.

Only complaints about the Sony XDR-S61D:

- The wake-up timer only works on DC;
- Switching from DC to batteries and vice-versa turns it off;
- It doesn't charge rechargeable batteries.
