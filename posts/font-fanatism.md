I've been using [PragmataPro](https://www.fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/) since 2015-04-28. It's a tall monospaced font designed by [Fabrizio Schiavi](https://www.fsd.it/).

At €199 for desktop and €199 for web, I'm glad I purchased it for both.

It powers most page on [my main website](https://pcarrier.com) and [formic.id](https://formic.id), my terminal, IDEs and editors, browsers, most apps on Linux, [my business cards](https://pcarrier.com/biz), [my overgrown deck of cards](https://pcarrier.com/biz). Really, I put it everywhere I think it fits. And I tend to think it fits everywhere, except lightweight websites as it takes a few MBs.
