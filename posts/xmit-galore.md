Made a bunch of improvements to xmit as I've found myself with plenty of time to spare.

## Faster site uploads

A few improvements behind the scenes (mostly parallelization) to make sure your sites upload faster
than ever.

## UI revamp

From the overall page structure and landing page to the admin interface split into more pages, through
the docs completely rethought to guide you through the process. The fastest path is a lot shorter thanks
to…

## Oncle Bob

A simple and lightweight graphical interface to start, build, and launch your site.
It's not particularly tied to xmit other than not supporting any other providers yet.
You can find it at [onclebob.com](https://onclebob.com).

## Analytics

Long awaited feature, analytics let you analyze your site's traffic in hits or bytes. You can slice
and dice by domain, path, client type, referrer, HTTP status, content type, and response size.
Available at [xmit.co/analytics](https://xmit.co/analytics).
