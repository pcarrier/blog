title: CAPTCHA… Why?

Been dealing with CAPTCHAs at work, and wow are they stupid.

Companies like [CAPSOLVER](https://www.capsolver.com/) are solving them faster than one can say “I'm not a robot” for dirt cheap.

So why don't we cut the middle person, the waste of time and energy on both sides of the equation, and offer micropayments as an alternative for the 99%? I'd gladly throw a fraction of a cent at websites to avoid the hassle. Heck, even 1¢ to save 10s of my time costs only $3.6/hour… What a bargain!

And once we have micropayments as alternatives to inferior user experiences, I'll gladly remove ads through bilateral financial agreements rather than undesired ad blockers.

I don't understand what stands in the way. Surely something does. The incentives are there for a microtransaction processing company to take its commission, for consumers to save time for what would be a nominal fee, and for the sites to fight bots through monetization… Win-win-win.

Why haven't Mozilla and Apple integrated a solution in their browsers yet? It truly seems like a no-brainer.
