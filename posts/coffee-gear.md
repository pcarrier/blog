Whilst I mostly brew [espresso](/posts/espresso-gear/), including [on the go](/posts/picopresso/), I also enjoy other coffee brewing methods. Here's my non-espresso coffee gear.

## Hario V60 Immersion Dripper

My favourite way to prepare a big cup of tasty coffee. Big fan of the cloth filter.

## Aeropress

A classic I rarely use. Cloth filter again.

## 6-cup Bialetti Moka Express

Bialetti's iconic Moka Express in its 6-cup format, with its induction adapter. A good solution if I want to make a lot of strong coffee quickly.

## 8-cup French Press

Simple and cheap, gets the job done. I follow [James Hoffman's technique](https://sevencoffeeroasters.com/blogs/coffee-101/james-hoffmann-french-press).
