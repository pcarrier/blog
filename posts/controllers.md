I love controllers. It's hard not to take one of each out for a bigger showcase.

They all make some sort of sense to me, with one exception. Can you spot the outlier?

Maybe I would need to spend more time with it, but after a few hours I don't understand how this left the lab.

I can't picture how 2 touch surfaces are even supposed to be used, neither with existing nor potential games.

I don't think they justify missing a D-pad, and the extremely common left joystick + buttons combination is cramped, with the buttons angled wrong for their low position.
