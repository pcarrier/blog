My employer, [Twin Labs](https://twin.so), builds ML-powered web automation.

We shipped my side project, [NetEscape](https://netescape.twin.so), an obstacle course for web agents.

Largely designed around our technology's current limitations, it proves a challenge for the agents we've put our hands on.

It is, however, easy for humans. [Feel free to try it!](https://netescape.twin.so) Should you complete it, we look forward to your submissionâ€¦
