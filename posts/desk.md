Here's my desk, where I spend way too much time. Please pardon the total lack of cable management.

[![My desk, overview](/assets/desk/overview.avif)](/assets/desk/overview.avif)

Probably the most obvious characteristic is the big display.

At 8K and 65 inches, the [Samsung Neo QLED 8K QN900D](https://www.samsung.com/fr/tvs/qled-tv/qn900d-65-inch-neo-qled-8k-tizen-os-smart-tv-tq65qn900dtxxc/) takes most of the space on my 200⨉50cm desk. While far from perfect, with a surface equivalent to 4⨉4K or 16⨉1080p, it's fantastic for interacting with and keeping an eye on tons of windows at once.

The sound system is a pair of [Focal Alpha 80 Evo](https://www.focal.com/products/alpha-80-evo) studio monitors I adore, connected to a [Mackie Mix5](https://mackie.com/en/products/mixers/mix-series/mix5.html) mixing table which has caused me a lot of troubles but does the job of mixing the audio from 2 computers at once.

[![Computers at my desk](/assets/desk/computers.avif)](/assets/desk/computers.avif)

There are, in fact, 3 computers in total.

- Following me almost everywhere, `cat`. A [MacBook Pro 14” M3 Max](https://www.apple.com/fr/macbook-pro/).

- Mostly here and often off, running Linux and Windows 11, `dog`. The “workstation” yet not involved in my job much, it provides a powerful environment for gaming, streaming, music composition, etc. It sports a [7950X3D](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/7000-series/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d.html), [RTX4090](https://www.nvidia.com/fr-fr/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4090/), plenty of RAM and storage for my needs.

- Always on, headless, `rabbit`. A fairly low-power [Framework](https://frame.work/) mainboard connected over Thunderbolt to 4⨉8TB of SSD storage in a [ThunderBay 4 mini](https://www.owc.com/solutions/thunderbay-4-mini-thunderbolt-3), and the other 2 computers when present. It acts as a NAS, media server, download box, Docker host, and more.

[![Inputs on my desk](/assets/desk/inputs.avif)](/assets/desk/inputs.avif)

To control them, I wouldn't deviate from the HHKB line of products; lately a [Happy Hacking Keyboard Hybrid Type-S Snow](https://www.hhkeyboard.com/uk/products/hhkb-hybrid-pro-type-s-snow). I resisted Type-S for far too long, I love its feel. For the pointer, I alternate between a [Logitech MX Master 3S](https://www.logitech.com/products/mice/mx-master-3s.910-006556.html) and a [Logitech MX Ergo](https://www.logitech.com/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.html).

Though my desk can be raised and lowered electrically, I rarely stand in front. My [Steelcase Gesture](https://steelcase.com/products/gesture) chair is quite comfortable.

Also pictured are:

- An [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket/) console;
- An [Xbox Elite Series 2](https://www.xbox.com/accessories/controllers/elite-wireless-controller-series-2) gamepad;
- A [Pixel 8 Pro](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_8_pro) phone;
- A [TWSBI Vac700R Iris](https://www.twsbi.com/collections/fountain-pens/products/twsbi-vac700r-iris-fountain-pen) fountain pen, [rOtring 800](https://www.rotring.com/pens-pencils/pencils/rotring-800/SAP_1904449.html) mechanical pencil, 4-color Bic pen;
- A [TX660](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/walkman-digital-recorders/audio-digital-voice-recorders/p/icdtx660) digital voice recorder;
- A Logitech Brio 4K Pro webcam;
- A ThinkPad keyboard (for the bootloader…).
