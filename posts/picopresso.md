Here's my mobile espresso setup, that I use when I'm out and about.

It has nothing on [my main setup](/posts/espresso-gear/) but size.

- [Picopresso by Wacaco](https://www.wacaco.com/products/picopresso)
- [1Zpresso J-Max](https://1zpresso.coffee/manual-jmax-en/)

Add roasted beans, a scale & a kettle. Compact yet capable.
