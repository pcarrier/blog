This article is painful to write. Not by nature but by means. I am not using a mouse for a few minutes and my keyboard is physically different for a few days. This is what my desk looks like right now:

[![My desk, zoom](/assets/calm/calm-2.avif)](/assets/calm/calm-2.avif)

Typing this in markdown, opening a preview took me a long time. Empathy for beginners. Reworking my workflows and tooling. Patience. A fair bit of cheating with the mouse, still. And little acceptance. This should work. Accessibility put to an arbitrary test.
