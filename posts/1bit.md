[Tristan Perich](https://www.tristanperich.com/) pushed chiptune to the limits with his 2010 [1-Bit Symphony](https://tristanperich.bandcamp.com/album/1-bit-symphony). The album is stored in a standard crystal case. When a switch is on, a battery powers a microchip which outputs music through a digital pin to a headphone jack. One button to skip tracks, one potentiometer to control volume. I adore the minimalism.

Mine doesn't play “correctly” anymore. I hope its production is unique.

Comes with a leaflet with the complete sources:
