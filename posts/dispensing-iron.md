Imagine a push‑button soldering iron that feeds molten solder right from the tip. Press the handle button and a controlled bead flows exactly where you need it. No separate wire to juggle. You get one‑handed precision, faster work, and cleaner joints, especially in tight spaces or field repairs.

Make it work. Make it affordable. Send me one.
