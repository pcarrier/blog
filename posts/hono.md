[Hono Coffee House](https://www.instagram.com/hono_coffee_house/) is my favourite coffee shop in Grenoble, France.

Carrying their own roast and that of nearby [Chulo](https://cafechulo.fr/),
offering a variety of brewing methods and alternative drinks,
they're a must-taste for any coffee lover visiting the city.

They also offer a great selection of vegan food, some gluten-free.

I visit almost daily, most often enjoy an oat milk flat white.
I'm also partial to their dirty chaï,
and would suggest espresso tonics if you're feeling adventurous.
