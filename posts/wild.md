I barely play any wind instruments. That is to say, I can play a couple of tunes poorly on the saxophone, and couple more on the tin whistle (Irish whistle).

A real beginner. In passing, I'd love a tool I can provide with appropriate sheet music to get it back annotated with tabs (fingerings and tonguings).

Yet despite barely knowing how to play anything, I couldn't resist a few purchases.

- The highlight of this post, a [Wild in D from McNeela](https://mcneelamusic.com/wild-irish-whistles/).

It's a lot pricier than the other tin whistles, but it's immediately clear why, and remains much cheaper than an entry-level saxophone.

It looks and feels premium in every way. As a beginner, I love how much easier it is to play on the Wild. Its tone sounds a lot more clear yet consistent (one might say forgiving) to me.
