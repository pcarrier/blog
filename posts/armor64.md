Every now and then I have to deal with base64. Most of the time, this leads to pain.

In 2016, I drafted a replacement, armor64. I once again got frustrated today, and “launched” the draft as a website at [armor64.org](https://armor64.org).

Friends don't let friends use base64. Encode different. Encode armor64.
