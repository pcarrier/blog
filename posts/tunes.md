Early study. It ain't good, but it's mine.

Played with (roughly) the constraints of a Game Boy first.

<audio controls><source src="/assets/music/t01.m4a"></audio>

<audio controls><source src="/assets/music/t02.m4a"></audio>

<audio controls><source src="/assets/music/t03.m4a"></audio>

Dropped the constraints, kept a video game feel.

<audio controls><source src="/assets/music/t04.m4a"></audio>

<audio controls><source src="/assets/music/t05.m4a"></audio>

<audio controls><source src="/assets/music/t06.m4a"></audio>

I'd like to find the time and motivation to make more.
