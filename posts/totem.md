Tiny post to share [my TOTEM layout](https://pcarrier.com/totem), programmed in anticipation of building a [TOTEM keyboard](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/TOTEM).

I was lukewarm on minimal keyboards after [the Planck](https://pcarrier.com/planck), but modding a HHKB Pro 2 & slightly switching layouts with a FUN60 Ultra TMR got me back in the mood to try them.
