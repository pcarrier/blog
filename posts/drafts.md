Two drafts that probably won't go further.

First one I quite enjoy but can't find the project file nor know how I'd elaborate.

Second one is my first attempt at lyrics, which follow.

> System boot — inhale  
> Process now — exhale  
> Scan thought — release  
> Update — inner peace
>
> Zero one — zero one  
> Impermanence for everyone  
> Zero one — zero one  
> Here and now we are one
>
> No-self protocol  
> Watch all rise and fall  
> Kindness sub-routine  
> Living in-between
>
> Zero one — zero one  
> Impermanence for everyone  
> Zero one — zero one  
> Here and now we are one
