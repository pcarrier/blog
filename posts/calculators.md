Given how slow [my CASIO PB-700](/posts/pb700) was at plotting graphs, around age 8, my parents upgraded me to the Sharp EL-9400 ([manual](/assets/calculators/el9400guide.pdf)).

It was a big step up for math, but barely programmable. I wanted a fast BASIC playground.

After a lot of starring in stores and begging, I received the dream machine: the TI-92 Plus ([manual](/assets/calculators/ti92plusguide.pdf)). It was a TI-89 in the body of a TI-92. Fantastic machine to code in BASIC and, as I discovered after breaking an arm, take notes in class.

Came with a powerful Symbolic Algebraic System and Cabri Géomètre (a brilliant app to construct geometry). Once I discovered how to transfer files from the Internet onto it, a lot of games followed.

It lasted quite a few years. When it finally gave up, I immediately replaced it with its successor, the TI Voyage 200 ([manual](/assets/calculators/voyage200manual.pdf)), which I've kept to this day.

Smaller form factor but AAA batteries instead of AA, double the flash, a really minor revision.

In my adult life, having lost interest in calculators for anything but quick calculations on the go, and having embraced RPN to the point of implementing [a postfix language](https://formic.id) for fun, I've acquired a HP Prime ([manual](/assets/calculators/hpprimemanual.pdf)).

Sadly, I don't care to get past the home screen anymore.
