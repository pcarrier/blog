The SlimBlade Pro [I adopted a month ago](/posts/slimbladepro/) can behave almost as described in that article using [Mac Mouse Fix](https://macmousefix.com/). Brilliantly simple:

I'm still missing a way to simulate a middle click with left and right buttons. Thought I had it with [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) but a left click still triggers as well:

If anybody knows a solution, please contact me! Though to be fair, I don't really need a middle button. I guess a delay would have to be introduced on normal left and right clicks, and I'd rather not.
